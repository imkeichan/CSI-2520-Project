For almost 5 decades, Issey Miyake has been pioneering the concept of modern Japanese heritage in fashion.
 As a survivor of post World War II trauma, Issey Miyake was born into the destruction of his country and participated in its rise and redemption.]
 After his studies, Miyake would travel to Paris then New York to accumulate experiences and ideas to build his fashion empire.
